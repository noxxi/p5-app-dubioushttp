While HTTP is defined in RFC2616 (HTTP/1.1) the specification does not address
every tiny detail. This makes browsers behave similar for the usual HTTP
traffic, but they differ in behavior regarding unusual or invalid traffic.

The same interpretation problems can be seen in security systems, e.g.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), proxies or firewalls. Thus differences in the
interpretation of HTTP leave enough room for circumventing these security
systems.

This module contains predefined tests to generate dubious HTTP responses.
The distribution contains also a script dubious_http.pl which can be used
as an HTTP server to serve these dubious HTTP responses. It can alternativly be
used to generate pcap-Files containing the dubious HTTP traffic, which instead
of life traffic can be fed for analysis into IDS systems.
