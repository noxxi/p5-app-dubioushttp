- Each tests now has a fixed ID which will not change over the development of
  the program, i.e. if tests gets added, deleted.... This ID can also be used
  directly, i.e. http://host/161/eicar.txt
- More tests:
  - hide data in gzip FEXTRA, made possible by using
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1244535
  - make use of too tolerant deflate/zlib handling in Chrome, Safari and FF.
    See commit 54ec8a6b8ce for details
  - FF uses strtoul to parsechunk size which accepts various prefixes and also
    signed data
  - some more status lines - chrome accepts almost anything
  - use ICY instead of HTTP/1.0 (FF only)
  - playing with 1xx preliminary response followed by real
  - Chrome accepts data partially compressed with gzip, rest uncompressed
  - Variations of HTTP version together with chunked and gzip
  - various kinds of white spaces, junk before header...

- Extend pcap mode to write single file and to filter based on reports
    - Extend pcap export mode: all streams into one file, filter...
    - new test for chunking with junk at the end, but content-length with
      the size of the good content. Edge will ignore the junk
- tool bin/test-sanitizing.pl to look how good a proxy will sanitize the traffic
  against strange requests typically understood by browsers but not by
  firewalls, /manifest/ URL to just get a listing of possible tests as plain
  text
- More tests:
  - combining chunked and gzip
  - tests with brotli (Firefox 44, https)
  - combine gzip header with RFC1950 (zlib) instead of RC1951 (deflate)
  - HTTP header containing TE chunked without a status line
  - chunked body:
    - chunking with junk and content-length limited to good data
    - Various browsers accept data after the chunk size
    - Especially Firefox accepts lots of data before the chunk size, even "\r\n\r\n"
    - Various browsers accept junk at the end, like "0\r\nfoobar\r\n"
  - status codes:
    - Variations on 204: 0204, 2040, 204 with chunked encoding. IE and Edge
      continue to accept 204 with body. 2040 is usually accepted but download
      not necessarily works.
    - Code 299: usually treated the same as 200
  - Content-length:
    - Chrome/Opera accept "," before length
    - all browsers accept "," after length
    - most browser accept anything after length, even something like "68A","68.9"...
  - tricky ends of HTTP header:
     - \n\r\r\n - Safari, IE, Edge
     - \n\r\r\n\r\n - others
     - IE and Edge accept "\n<space>\n" or "\n\t\n"
  - line folding after key and before colon, i.e. Transfer-Encoding\n\t:chunked
    This will be accepted by Safari.
  - broken "white-space" and line folding:
    Chrome treats \n\000chunked as proper line folding, while the others don't
  - characters before and after the field or the colon
    - While Safari accepts anything before and after "chunked" (tested in
      Chunked.pm) it only accepts some characters before/after gzip and deflate.
      Among these are \v,\f,";" and \240 (latin1 non-breaking space)
    - FF, Chrome accept "," before and after chunked|gzip|deflate
  - \000 is nearly everywhere in the header ignored by Chrome (inside, before
    and after key and value...)
  - broken status lines
    - "HTTP/1.1foobar" (no status code etc) gets accepted by Chrome, Opera and
      Firefox.
  - various tests with invalid characters or UTF-8
  - extend compression tests with various kinds of sync between deflated parts

2015/11/12 0.029
- bulk testing of iframe tags with HTML inside
2015/11/08 0.028
- bulk testing of behavior regarding Javascript and Image loading (instead
  of only XHR)
2015/10/31 0.027
- way more tests of broken responses
- add tests for gzip compression flags and features
- add support for lzma compression, supported by at least Opera
- option --fast-feedback so that results  gets submitted in parts once they grow to big
- new script bin/normalize-logs.pl to normalize log files
2015/10/01 0.026
- add optional SSL and IPv6 support
- add more tests and fixed some 
- add more detailed output
2015/09/14 0.025
- some more tests
- better description for some tests
- enforce download via download attribute for eicar.txt etc
- according to RFC2616 a content-encoding header with 'identity' should not
  be used, moved to UNCOMMON_INVALID and added variations with double
  encoding etc
- complain if the firewall blocks sane response without virus, because that
  might indicate that they employ a URL filter only or similar
- If one evasion failed re-check with novirus.txt if it failed because of the
  firewall or because the browser considered the response invalid. Also add
  these information to the summary for the user and tell the user again how to
  check for false positives and how EICAR looks like.
- give summary and offer a way to give feedback with product details
- log response header we got for initial innocent and test virus request
2015/09/04 0.024
- if in the automated evasion test the initial simple request to eicar.txt
  results in the expected failure add the error message to the results sent
  in /submit_results
- track different request headers, i.e order of fields etc to distinguish browsers 
  and changes done by proxies
- by default garble URLs so firewalls can not simply block all URLs with 
  eicar.txt inside, switch off with --no-garble-url. It will still accept
  ungarbled URLs but produce garbled ones.
- with http://host/broken/ALL/testid etc one will get the test line with
  image, script, html ... for only this test (i.e http://host/broken/ALL/302).
2015/08/21 0.023
- lots of beautification and documentation

  strict when including scripts)

- add some more tests

2015/07/29 0.021
- make sure we always send some kind of length (Content-length or chunked)
  because some firewalls don't scan content with unspecified length which
  would then distort test results
